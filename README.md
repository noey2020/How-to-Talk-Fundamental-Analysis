Key fundamental data, developed by S&P Global Market Intelligence for Fidelity,
combine a number of fundamental data elements to present an overall assessment of a
company‚Äôs valuation, quality, growth stability and financial health in relation to
other firms in the same sector. These key metrics focus on particular components to
help customers understand a company‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses in specific areas
compared to its peers.

One of the strengths of this model is the way it changes its use of underlying
fundamental data based upon the sector/sub-sector that is being assessed.
It is well known that analyzing banks requires different fundamentals than those used
for other sectors within the classification system. Similarly, the non-bank financial sector
has analytical differences from both banks and other sectors (e.g. loan loss reserves is
an important data point for banks, but not for non-banks). For this reason, the model
uses different fundamental data sets to analyze banks and non-bank financial
companies. The nine sectors, outside of the finance sector, can be assessed using the
same fundamental information. Despite these differences, the result is four key metrics
‚Äì valuation, overall quality, growth stability and financial health that apply to each stock
across Fidelity.com.

The four components are measured using a range between 1 and 100, with 1 being low,
overvalued or less healthy and 100 being high, undervalued or healthy, as applicable.
The four components include:

ÔÅÆ Valuation - The valuation metric combines fundamental data to determine if a
company is overvalued or undervalued in relation to its peers.

ÔÅÆ Quality ‚Äì The quality metric uses fundamental data to assess a company‚Äôs
overall earnings quality in relation to its peers. This metric uses information
across all financial statements of the firm.

ÔÅÆ Growth Stability ‚Äì Growth Stability is an assessment of how stable the growth
of earnings and cash flow has been over time. Companies with greater growth
stability in comparison to their peers are more highly rated by this measure.

ÔÅÆ Financial Health ‚Äì Financial Health uses fundamental data to view the
company‚Äôs debt and interest obligations (among other factors) to its financial
health in comparison to its peers.

Fundamental analysis is only one approach to analyzing stocks. When considering
which stocks to buy or sell, you should use the approach that you're most comfortable
with. As with all your investments, you must make your own determination as to whether
an investment in any particular security or securities is right for you based on your
investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results.
